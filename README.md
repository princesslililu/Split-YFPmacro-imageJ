# Split-YFPmacro-imageJ
To batch open and process .lif files
dependendies:

Bio-format ImageJ plugin https://imagej.net/Bio-Formats

I recommened using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ which has many plugins already installed for confocal microscopy image analysis https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads

Once in imageJ, I use the macro by naviagting to  Plugins>Macros>Run...  and then slecting the the .ijm file.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work when I install it so far.
